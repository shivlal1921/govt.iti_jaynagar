 Directorate General of Training (DGT) under Ministry of Skill Development and Entrepreneurship, being the apex organization for development and coordination of vocational training at the national level, takes steps from time to time to improve various aspects as per the changing market and industry. The curriculum for specified trades under Craftsmen Training Scheme (CTS) is one of the most important concepts in this entire venture. The traditional way of designing curriculum is skill-based in principle and has been designed in the same manner till date. In 2015, DGT initiated a significant change to incorporate the concept of competency-based. Rather than focusing on the process of learning, this concept requires focus on what a person is expected to do at the workplace. In other words the objective of “competency based training” establishes a direct link between what trainees are supposed to learn in the institutions and the knowledge and skills required to be employable.

To bring about a shift towards competency-based training, DGT is in the process of aligning the syllabus of each CTS trade with the appropriate NSQF (National Skills Qualifications Framework) level. Syllabus of several CTS trades have been NSQF aligned and they include Information and Communication Technology System Maintenance.
